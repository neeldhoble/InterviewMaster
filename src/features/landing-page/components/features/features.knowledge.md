# Features Section Documentation

## Component Structure
The features section uses a bento grid layout with:
- One tall component (TowerBento)
- Two square components (SquareBento1, SquareBento2)
- One rectangular component (RectangularBento)

## Performance Considerations
- All components are lazy loaded using Next.js dynamic imports
- Loading states are provided for better UX
- Animations are optimized to prevent layout shifts

## Best Practices
- Keep animations lightweight
- Ensure responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- Use semantic HTML for better accessibility

## Common Issues
- Animation performance on mobile devices
- Layout shifts during component loading
- Responsive image handling

## Tips
- Test on various devices for animation performance
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to monitor
- Keep component dependencies minimal
