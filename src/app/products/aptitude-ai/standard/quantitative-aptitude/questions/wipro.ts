    question: 'A boat can travel with a speed of 13 km/hr in still water. If the speed of the stream is 4 km/hr, find the time taken by the boat to go 68 km downstream.',
    options: [
      'a) 4 hours',
      'b) 5 hours',
      'c) 4.5 hours',
      'd) 5.5 hours'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'a',
    explanation: 'Speed downstream = Speed in still water + Speed of stream\n= 13 + 4 = 17 km/hr\nTime = Distance/Speed = 68/17 = 4 hours',

      'a) 20 km/hr',
      'b) 25 km/hr',
      'c) 30 km/hr',
      'd) 35 km/hr'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'b',
    explanation: 'Let distance between A and B be x km\nTime taken by trains to meet = t hours\n60t + 25t = x\n60(t+4) = x\n25(t+9) = x\nSolving gives second train speed = 25 km/hr',
